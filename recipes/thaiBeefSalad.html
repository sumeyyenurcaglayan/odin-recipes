<h1>Thai Beef Salad</h1>
<img src="./fotos/thai-beef-salad.jpg"/>
<h4>Thai cuisine is one of contrasts and Thai beef salad is a perfect example. In the dressing alone, sweet meets salty, spicy and sour and in the salad intense chilli meets gentle aromatic herbs and cooling cucumber, all coming together in perfect harmony.
A much loved and ordered restaurant item, this Thai beef salad recipe brings this heavenly dish into your own home. The secret? While most Thai beef salad recipes just season and grill the meat, this recipe uses the ingenious trick of marinating it in half of the dressing. This not only flavours and tenderises the meat, but the palm sugar in the dressing helps caramelise the surface. Known as yum nua, this Thai beef salad is easy enough to be cooked as a weeknight dinner, but also special enough to be served as part of a Thai banquet.</h3>
